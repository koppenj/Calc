Foundations: Project Calculator

Update 8/28/21:
  At this time, I feel like I have tackled the majority of the calculator project.
I know there are a couple issues, namely the display overflowing with too many values. But I feel like I should just leave it and move on, mostly to leave it to look back in time and admire what I've accomplished to now.
  In this project, I have vastly improved my understanding of:

  1. DOM Manipulation
  2. Event Listeners
  3. CSS in general
  4. Using the debugger in Chrome

  Down the road, I would love to implement keyboard support, along with functions such as percentage and square root.
